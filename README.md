# python-multifile-IO-handling
Handling multiple ASCII files I/O and manipulation of content using Python

This repo is an excercise to handle multiple ASCII files in the same directory, from a single Python script.
Each .txt file present in the directory is opened individually and some dummy handling is perfomed. A new output file (.out) that corresponds to these handlings is created for each file opened.

Created by Massimo Pinto based on existing Python modules.
